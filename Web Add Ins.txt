The only addin that is one-page by default is Standard Windows. All others must be added when starting up in UFT. • Web Addin is no exception.

Check that Web Addin is added when starting UFT 
• UFT must be started before the browser 
• Record and Replay settings

ZOOM In Browser
If everything ends up wrong, highlight or SPY does not work



Do not start the browser with UFT's built-in menu functions 
• Code gives freedom of movement



Normally in Web, all information is in "inner text" but there are exceptions: –WebCheckBox, checked: 0 or 1 – WebEdit, Value 
• Tip: Enter a value, open OR manager, spy, add, click plus, look up what you entered



There are all sorts of things to do with these. Set, Select, etc. 
• It is almost impossible to keep track of what applies to what 
• Tip: Drag-drop from OR, then UFT pastes what is Default operation, which is to Click for buttons, but to set the value for the other gadgets.



Test-> Settings-> Run-> Object synchronization timeout: Default 20 seconds
• Exists (<seconds>) will wait no more than the specified number of secondsBUT! It goes without saying that the parent chain exists! 
• Tip: If the parents may not exist, wait for them first!

VILKA object FUNC
Browser and Page 
• Do not confuse this with ClickSync etc which is available for Siebel objects 
• There are also functions in LTE that you can use to check how "finished" a page is.


JavaScript on the page? 
• Java Object with connections on the server side? 
• SiebelOpenUI (yes, it's web) with server support? 
• Sometimes a Click in the object is enough 
• Sometimes DeviceReplay is needed 
• Sometimes you can navigate via the keyboard


PC not the only platform, there is Tablet, PC with Touch, Mobile ... 
• Built-in support in Web for "Pinch", "Swipe", "LongPress", "HoverTap", etc. 
• Do not forget the Ctrl button at Object-Spy !


Previous sections on Object Recognition: Native 
• Advantages: Access to the browser's own implementation – Everything is possible – You get the same power as the developer 
• Disadvantages: Access to the browser's own implementation – IE is different from Firefox which is different from Chrome – What works for one browser may have the opposite effect in another

Last ace in the rock sleeve, send events 
• Web objects have a function "FireEvent" 
• Is in the help which events are for which objects 
• In automation we have often used "onfocusout" which means ~ "I have finished entering"
